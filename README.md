# Hello everybody, my name is Daniel 👋
I'm a JavaScript developer, mainly focused on the front-end development
- 🏠 I was born in Ostrava, Czechia
- 🏢 I currently work as a senior web developer (full-time) at Gendigital (formerly known as Avast/Nortonlifelock)
- 📚 Trying to find a time to explore a little bit of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and brush up my [React](https://react.dev/) skills in general
- 🚀 Future goals: Making every year better than the last!
